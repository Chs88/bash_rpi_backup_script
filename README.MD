#bash_rpi_backup_script
##Introduction
This is a much simpler and less useful version of the [python_backup_script](https://github.com/Chs88/python_rpi_backup_script) I have created to create backups for my Raspberry Pi.
The script was created to practice bash. 
All variable names, directory names and hard drive names are specific to my personal case.
